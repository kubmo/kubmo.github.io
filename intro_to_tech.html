	<h2>Overview:</h2>
	<p>We are now in an age of digital technology, where there are so many opportunities opening up for people around the world. The internet has created an open source platform for anyone to learn, make money, and connect with a diverse community. This workshop will focus on career development and professional tools that can be accessed online. All levels of technology adopters are welcome in this discussion-based session.</p>

	<h2>Goals:</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Group discussion on technology: Talk in small groups about how technology can be used in their personal lives, and in a professional setting. Discuss specific goals of each woman to find out what they might need.</li>
		<li>Inspirational career talks: Hear from Andrea Del Rio on what she does day to day professionally, how technology plays a role, and how she gained the skills they needed to succeed. Emma and Kinsey will talk briefly about what they do as a designer and back end developer in the US.</li>
		<li>Learning resources:  Provide a list of resources for continued learning. We will create a shared messaging group (platform to be decided), where we can continue discussions on self learning. Do a brief intro on how to use a few of the platforms in each group depending on level and interest.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Basic Schedule:</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Introductions + Welcome (30 minutes): Brief introduction to familiarize participants with the goals of the workshop and make all levels feel welcome. Have a group discussion about what technology is, and the type of technology we will be talking about. Break into groups where each woman receives printouts to follow along with and take notes.</li>
		<li>Group session 1 (30 minutes): Participants will be broken into groups based on level (Break up by self identification prior to workshop). 1-2 leaders will sit with each of the participants to talk about using the internet and devices for career growth and skill building. Ask each participant to talk about their career goals, and suggest ways for technology to help them get there. For lower levels, talk about what technology is to them, and help them decide at a basic level how technology can help them day to day. Have participants write down their thoughts before discussing as a group.</li>
		<li>Career presentations (1 hour): Andrea will give an interactive presentation on her career and how it fits into life in Peru. 2-3 other leaders talk briefly about their careers in technology - what do they do daily, how did they get there, why do they love it? We will end with presenting some jobs specific to the Cusco area.</li>
		<li>Google docs (20 minutes): Short introduction on google docs. Show them a few pre made projects in sheets, docs, and sheets that they can build off of once they are in groups.</li>
		<li>Group session 2 (1.5 hours): Take one of the projects made in google docs, and use multiple devices to finish the project. Discuss ways this could be used for career growth. Try to get each participant to actively use the tool, and ask questions.</li>
		<li>Presentations: Wrap up sessions, have a leader from each group talk about what they made, and how they think they could use the tool moving forward. End on a positive note - show facebook page, and social media links for Kubmo - where everyone can join for more resources and tools.</li>
